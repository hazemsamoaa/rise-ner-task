In the experimentation, we observed distinct outcomes when tuning the model with fewer classes compared to a broader class set. The model trained in System A displayed more robust performance in certain instances. This divergence can be attributed to data sparsity in System B, where non-targeted entity tags were uniformly labeled as zero. This approach inadvertently led to a class imbalance dominated by the 'zero' label. Addressing class imbalance typically involves techniques like SMOTE, but our methodology did not incorporate such measures.

Furthermore, we employed two distinct training approaches: utilizing Hugging Face's training utilities and directly training with PyTorch. The latter proved more time-intensive, possibly due to the resource constraints of our setup. Our models were trained for only two epochs, constrained by available resources. Despite this limitation, there's a consensus that extending training beyond this point could potentially lead to overfitting.

Overall, while the reduced-class model (System B) demonstrated effectiveness in certain metrics, its performance was hindered by class imbalance and data sparsity. In contrast, the more comprehensive class model (System A) maintained robustness across a broader range of examples.
